<h1>Comment PreProcessor (CPP)</h1>
Writing a Comment PreProcessor is easy, all you have to do is write a console application that reads the comments from the standard input and write the processed comments to the standard output.<br>
Because starting an application for every comment generates a lot of overhead UnCodeX will only start the CPP once and write all comments to it. Each comment is seperated by an ASCII char 4 (End Of Transmission or ^D). Your output will also need to seperate each comment with a ^D. Also make sure you flush your output, it's best to disable output buffering.
<p>
For an example CPP check the UnCodeX CVS repository, there's a project called 'ucxcpp'.
