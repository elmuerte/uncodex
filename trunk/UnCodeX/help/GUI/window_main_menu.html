<h1>Main menu</h1>
<h2>Tree</h2>
<h3>Rebuild and Analyse</h3>
This is a batch command that will rebuild the tree and analyse all classes. Use this option when you are sure you don't have any orphan classes.
<h3>Rebuild tree</h3>
Scan the source paths for packages and classes and rebuild the package and class tree.
<h3>Find orphans</h3>
Scan the classes to find orphan classes, classes that have a parent class but are not listed in the class tree. This is usualy the result of an incorrect configuration of the <a href="window_settings.html#packagepriority">package priority</a>
<h3>Analyse all classes</h3>
Analyse the content of all classes. This will search each class for variables, functions, structures, etc. You need to analyse all classes before you can use the more advanced features of UnCodeX like the HTML generation or class properties window. You only have to do this once after you rebuild the tree.
<h3>Analyse modified classes</h3>
This will only analyse the classes that have been modified since the last time the class has been analysed. This can be <a href="window_settings.html#programoptions">done on start-up</a>
<h3>Save state</h3>
Save the state of the current tree. This is done automatically when the program closes
<h3>Load state</h3>
Load the tree state, this is done at start up.
<h3>Settings</h3>
Open the <a href="window_settings.html">settings window</a>
<h3>Quit</h3>
Close UnCodeX

<h2>Find</h2>
<h3>Find class & Full Text Search</h3>
This will open the <a href="window_search.html">search dialog</a>, it will allow you to search the tree, or the source files, for a text you enter.

<h3>Find next</h3>
This will search for the next match, this can also be used after an "inline search" done in a tree.

<h2>View</h2>
This menu is also available when you right click the application title bar.
These option will toggle the visibility of various items in the main window.
<h3>Tool window</h3>
These options control if the main window should be registered as a Tool window. A tool window is a special window that get's a reserved part on the screen that no other application can use. Like the windows task bar, or the office tool bar.
<br>
It's adviced to turn on the "stay on top" option when you enable the tool window feature.
