<h2>Changes since 216</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue when recreating classtree\analyse all and property inspector was hidden</li>
<li>Added more exception catching during package scanning</li>
<li>More memory leak fixes</li>
<li>Improved conditional compiling for the GUI. Define <code>DEBUG_BUILD</code> for a debug build with the right settings.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes since 215</h2>
<ul>
<li>Debug compiles (unless I forget to enable it) are now compiled with a memory leak detection ( http://v.mahon.free.fr/pro/freeware/memcheck ). To enable the memory leak detection start UnCodeX with <code>-findmemleak</code>. This will produce a file called <code>UnCodeX_MemCheck.log</code> when UnCodeX is closed. If that file contains information please email it to me.
</ul>

<li>Fixed a bug in the HTML otuput comment parsing, some links where not converted correctly.
<li>Added new function to UClasses: <code>function declaration: string;</code> This returns a valid unrealscript declaration of that function/variable/etc. Note: this may not be exact as the source declaration.
